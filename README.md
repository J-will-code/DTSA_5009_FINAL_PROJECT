# DTSA_5009_FINAL_PROJECT
In this project I will be making use of Logistic Regression, Decision trees, and Random Tree Classifier as predictive models to evaluate what group of persons were more likely to survive using passenger data.
Based on the best accuracy, we will employ the best model on a random passenger to see if he would survive the tragic event.
