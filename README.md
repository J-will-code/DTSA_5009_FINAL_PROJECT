# DTSA_5509_FINAL_PROJECT

In this project, we will be making use of the Random Tree Classifier as a predictive model. We'll import data from the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with house price data from Zillow. We'll merge and combine the data, then use it to train a random forest model. The model will predict if house prices will increase or decrease per quarter. We'll measure error using backtesting, then improve our model with new predictors.
